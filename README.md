## Usages
HTML used to create the static framework of the landing page

CSS used to stylize the HTML of the landing page

Javascript used to turn the static page into a dynamic page
This allows for:
- `navLink` to set anchor for new link
- `nav.Link.textContent` to set the new link to text
- `navLink.href` to link navigation link to its corresponding page
- `targetSection.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" }` allows for the motion of the page. When a link on the navigation bar is clicked, a smooth transition from the top of the page to the section its linked to occurs.
